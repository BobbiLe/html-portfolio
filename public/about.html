<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>At 23, I embraces a lifestyle focused on relaxation and creativity. Painting serves as a primary escape, 
  allowing for self-expression and bursts of inspiration. The colors and strokes capture their imagination, giving them a 
  way to communicate thoughts and emotions without words. This creative pursuit often competes with a deep-seated love for 
  stories, whether through colorful manhwa or captivating anime.</p>

<p>Anime and manhwa aren’t just pastimes; they’re a cherished part of daily life. They bring rich worlds and complex 
  characters to life, providing both comfort and inspiration. These stories are a means to delve into thrilling, 
  fantastical realms that break up the monotony of the daily grind. Eating and sleeping round out this cozy routine, 
  offering small but essential pleasures.</p>

<p>Working, however, is met with little enthusiasm, as it clashes with a desire for freedom and self-directed 
  activities. Obligations feel like an unwanted interruption, pulling them away from the things that matter most. 
  To them, life is best enjoyed through restful afternoons, savory snacks, and imaginative escapes into art and stories.</p>
